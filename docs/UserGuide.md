The appeal: crisp speed, minimal friction, and a workflow built for event planners who want proficiency without fuss.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- All fields will be automatically trimmed (no spacing before or after each parameter) when input inside the command

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-contact n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `<blank>` means that an empty field (i.e. " ") can be used to define nothing for supported commands

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for the commands `help`, `exit` and `clear` will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Contacts

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
❗Each person cannot have the same name (case-insensitive).
</div>

### Adding a person: `add-contact`

Adds a person to the address book. A person is uniquely identified only by their name in 
OverBooked; that is, that 2 contacts are considered different people as long as their names are 
different in a case-insensitive comparison. This also means that 2 different people can have the 
same phone number, address and email address.

The command will remove any filters currently in the contact list after execution.

Format: `add-contact n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:

- `add-contact n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

an EventAlias cannot be edited in order to enforce uniqueness
The event alias field included in the field is to identify which specific event you want to amend.
</div>

Format: `edit-event ea/EVENT_ALIAS [en/EVENT_NAME] [st/START_DATETIME] [et/END_DATETIME] [d/DESCRIPTION]`

At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

Only the alias is searched.
Events whose aliases start with at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `tsc` will return 
`TSC2024`, `TSC2025`. In short, the search does not require the full alias to match the searched 
prefix.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
list-events can be used to remove the filter. add-event and edit-event will also remove the filter after its execution.
</div>

### Saving the data

OverBooked data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

OverBooked data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If the data file becomes an invalid json or fields no longer fall within given restrictions after user edits, OverBooked will create a new empty file to replace it. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the OverBooked to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

---

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous OverBooked
home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
